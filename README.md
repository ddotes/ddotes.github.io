# Dotes Frontend

The website is a combination of a diary journal and normal notes. Thus, the name "dotes". To get started, visit the link to the website and create an account. If I may ask, please be patient with the loading times as the backend is running on a free linux server and the database is on a raspberry pi. 

This was created using the angular framework for the frontend and a springboot backend.
